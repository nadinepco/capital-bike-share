# Capital Bike Share Regression Project
Using the [Bike Sharing Demand Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data), this project's goal is to predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using only information available prior to the rental period.
